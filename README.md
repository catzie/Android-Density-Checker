# Android-Density-Checker
Shows if your device is uses ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, or xxxhdpi

## How it works
I have an image of same name in different density folders (e.g. drawable-xhdpi) with different texts corresponding to density label. This app just shows you which folder Android will pull an image for your device.

## Limitation
The images are too small on some devices
